# Database

While trying the dhtmlxGantt (not made by me) I learnt some basic php and SQL (in the src and sql folders).

For the dhtmlxGantt, I've played with it a little.
I want to add some explaination on how to set a local webserver to try such as WAMP or else.

I store everything here, so I can easily get back to it.
