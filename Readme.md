# Database [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/affcc041625a4f1f8a90ef3384fa5135)](https://www.codacy.com/app/Sylhare/Database?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=Sylhare/Database&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

While trying the [dhtmlxGantt](https://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxGantt/), I learnt some basic php and SQL (in the src and sql folders).

For the dhtmlxGantt, I've played with it a little.
I want to add some explaination on how to set a local webserver to try such as WAMP or else.

I store everything here, so I can easily get back to it.
